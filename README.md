# MentalHealthPrevalenceCapstoneProject
Predicting high depression prevalence using global mental health data with machine learning model.
# Mental Health Prevalence Capstone Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global mental health data to predict individuals with high depression prevalence using machine learning.  
The goal is to provide insights that can support mental health awareness and early intervention strategies.
